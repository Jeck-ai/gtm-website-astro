      <h2>EU Online Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
      <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws. However, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
